    <title>No-Go Theorems for Quantum Resource Distillation</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02540</link>
    <author>Kun Fang, Zi-Wen Liu</author>
    <description>Distillation, which generally means converting noisy states into better approximations of some valuable pure states by low-cost operations, is a fundamental type of resource trading protocol that plays major roles in quantum computation and information processing. In this work, we establish a series of fundamental limits to the efficiency of distillation with finite resources which apply to any reasonable resource theory, using an information-theoretic tool called the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy. We show that, for highly generic noisy inputs, there is an insuperable limitation to the accuracy (or lower bound on the error) of any distillation protocol, even probabilistic ones. More explicitly, our bounds indicate a forbidden regime of the accuracy and success probability that no protocol with the corresponding parameters can exist. We use these no-go theorems to derive bounds which imply that the total overhead i.e. the number of noisy inputs needed to distill a pure resource state with small error $\epsilon$ must scale at least as $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$. This allows us to establish specific lower bounds on the cost of magic state distillation, a task crucial to fault-tolerant quantum computation, which in particular address an open problem raised by Hastings and Haah [PRL 120, 050504 (2018)]. Finally, we showcase a basic no-go result for simulating unitary resource channels to demonstrate that the analogous understandings may extend to channel resource theories.</description>

    <title>Quantum Brascamp-Lieb Dualities</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02383</link>
    <author>Mario Berta, David Sutter, Michael Walter</author>
    <description>Brascamp-Lieb inequalities are entropy inequalities which have a dual formulation as generalized Young inequalities. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum version of this duality, relating quantum relative entropy inequalities to matrix exponential inequalities of Young type. We demonstrate this novel duality by means of examples from quantum information theory - including entropic uncertainty relations, strong data-processing inequalities, super-additivity inequalities, and many more. As an application we find novel uncertainty relations for Gaussian quantum operations that can be interpreted as quantum duals of the well-known family of geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequalities.</description>

    <title>Quantum Natural Gradient</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02108</link>
    <author>James Stokes, Josh Izaac, Nathan Killoran, Giuseppe Carleo</author>
    <description>A quantum generalization of Natural Gradient Descent is presented as part of a general-purpose optimization framework for variational quantum circuits. The optimization dynamics is interpreted as moving in the steepest descent direction with respect to the Quantum Information Geometry, corresponding to the real part of the Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT), also known as the Fubini-Study metric tensor. An efficient algorithm is presented for computing a block-diagonal approximation to the Fubini-Study metric tensor for parametrized quantum circuits, which may be of independent interest.</description>

    <title>Alibaba Cloud Quantum Development Platform: Applications to Quantum Algorithm Design</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02559</link>
    <author>Cupjin Huang, Mario Szegedy, Fang Zhang, Xun Gao, Jianxin Chen, Yaoyun Shi</author>
    <description>We report our work on the Alibaba Cloud Quantum Development Platform (AC-QDP). The capability of AC-QDP's computational engine was already reported in \citeCZH+18, ZHN+19.In this follow-up article, we demonstrate with figures how AC-QDP helps in testing large-scale quantum algorithms (currently within the QAOA framework). We give new benchmark results on regular graphs. AC-QDP's QAOA framework can simulate thousands of qubits for up to $4$ layers. Then we discuss two interesting use cases we have implemented on the platform: 1. Optimal QAOA sequences for small-cycle free graphs; 2. Graph structure discovery.</description>

    <title>Playing Games with Multiple Access Channels</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02479</link>
    <author>Felix Leditzky, Mohammad A. Alhejji, Joshua Levin, Graeme Smith</author>
    <description>Communication networks have multiple users, each sending and receiving messages. A multiple access channel (MAC) models multiple senders transmitting to a single receiver, such as the uplink from many mobile phones to a single base station. The optimal performance of a MAC is quantified by a capacity region of simultaneously achievable communication rates. We study the two-sender classical MAC, the simplest and best-understood network, and find a surprising richness in both a classical and quantum context. First, we find that quantum entanglement shared between senders can substantially boost the capacity of a classical MAC. Second, we find that optimal performance of a MAC with bounded-size inputs may require unbounded amounts of entanglement. Third, determining whether a perfect communication rate is achievable using finite-dimensional entanglement is undecidable. Finally, we show that evaluating the capacity region of a two-sender classical MAC is in fact NP-hard.</description>

    <title>Optimizing Clifford gate generation for measurement-only topological quantum computation with Majorana zero modes</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03002</link>
    <author>Alan Tran, Alex Bocharov, Bela Bauer, Parsa Bonderson</author>
    <description>One of the main challenges for quantum computation is that while the number of gates required to perform a non-trivial quantum computation may be very large, decoherence and errors in realistic quantum architectures limits the number of physical gate operations that can be performed coherently. Therefore, an optimal mapping of the quantum algorithm into the physically available set of operations is of crucial importance. We examine this problem for a measurement-only topological quantum computer based on Majorana zero modes, where gates are performed through sequences of measurements. Such a scheme has been proposed as a practical, scalable approach to process quantum information in an array of topological qubits built using Majorana zero modes. Building on previous work that has shown that multi-qubit Clifford gates can be enacted in a topologically protected fashion in such qubit networks, we discuss methods to obtain the optimal measurement sequence for a given Clifford gate under the constraints imposed by the physical architecture, such as layout and the relative difficulty of implementing different types of measurements. Our methods also provide tools for comparative analysis of different architectures and strategies, given experimental characterizations of particular aspects of the systems under consideration.</description>

    <title>Generalized topological state-sum constructions and their universality</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03031</link>
    <author>Andreas Bauer</author>
    <description>We formalize and generalize the concept of a topological state-sum construction using the language of tensor networks. We give examples for constructions that are possibly more general than all state-sum constructions in the literature that we are aware of. In particular we propose a state-sum construction that is universal in the sense that it can emulate every other state-sum construction. Physically, state-sum models in $n$ dimensions correspond to fixed point models for topological phases of matter in $n$ space-time dimensions. We conjecture that our universal state-sum construction contains fixed point models for topological phases that are not captured by known constructions. In particular we demonstrate that, unlike common state-sum constructions, the construction is compatible with the absence of gapped boundaries and commuting-projector Hamiltonians in $2+1$-dimensional chiral topological phases.</description>
