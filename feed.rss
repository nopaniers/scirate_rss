    <description>The chain rule for the classical relative entropy ensures that the relative entropy between probability distributions on multipartite systems can be decomposed into a sum of relative entropies of suitably chosen conditional distributions on the individual systems. Here, we prove a similar chain rule inequality for the quantum relative entropy in terms of channel relative entropies. The new chain rule allows us to solve an open problem in the context of asymptotic quantum channel discrimination: surprisingly, adaptive protocols cannot improve the error rate for asymmetric channel discrimination compared to non-adaptive strategies. In addition, we give examples of quantum channels showing that the channel relative entropy is not additive under the tensor product.</description>

    <description>We describe a resource-efficient approach to studying many-body quantum states on noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. We employ a sequential generation model that allows to bound the range of correlations in the resulting many-body quantum states. From this, we characterize situations where the estimation of local observables does not require the preparation of the entire state. Instead smaller patches of the state can be generated from which the observables can be estimated. This reduces the required circuit size and number of qubits for the computation of physical properties of quantum matter. Moreover, we show that the effect of noise decreases along the computation. Our results apply to a broad class of widely studied tensor network states and can be directly applied to near-term implementations of variational quantum algorithms.</description>

    <title>Cayley path and quantum computational supremacy: A proof of average-case $\#P-$hardness of Random Circuit Sampling with quantified robustness</title>

    <description>A one-parameter unitary-valued interpolation between any two unitary matrices (e.g., quantum gates) is constructed based on the Cayley transformation, which extends our previous work [15]. We prove that this path provides scrambled unitaries with probability distributions arbitrarily close to the Haar measure. We then prove the simplest known average-case #$P$-hardness of random circuit sampling (RCS), which is the task of sampling from the output distribution of a quantum circuit whose local gates are random Haar unitaries, and is the lead candidate for demonstrating quantum supremacy in the NISQ era. We show that previous work based on the truncations of the power series representation of the exponential function does not provide practical robustness. Explicit bound on noise resilience is proved, which for an $n-$qubit device with the near term experimental parameters is $2^{-\Theta(n^{3.51})}$ robustness with respect to additive error. Improving this to $\mathcal{O}(2^{-n}/\text{poly}(n))$ would prove the quantum supremacy conjecture; and proving our construction optimal would disprove it</description>

    <title>Variational Quantum Linear Solver: A Hybrid Algorithm for Linear Systems</title>

    <description>Solving linear systems of equations is central to many engineering and scientific fields. Several quantum algorithms have been proposed for linear systems, where the goal is to prepare $|x\rangle$ such that $A|x\rangle \propto |b\rangle$. While these algorithms are promising, the time horizon for their implementation is long due to the required quantum circuit depth. In this work, we propose a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving linear systems, with the aim of reducing the circuit depth and doing much of the computation classically. We propose a cost function based on the overlap between $|b\rangle$ and $A|x\rangle$, and we derive an operational meaning for this cost in terms of the solution precision $\epsilon$. We also introduce a quantum circuit to estimate this cost, while showing that this cost cannot be efficiently estimated classically. Using Rigetti's quantum computer, we successfully implement our algorithm up to a problem size of $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we numerically find that the complexity of our algorithm scales efficiently in both $1/\epsilon$ and $\kappa$, with $\kappa$ the condition number of $A$. Our algorithm provides a heuristic for quantum linear systems that could make this application more near term.</description>

    <title>Near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations</title>

    <description>Solving linear systems of equations is an essential component in science and technology, including in many machine learning algorithms. Existing quantum algorithms have demonstrated large speedup in solving linear systems, but the required quantum resources are not available on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we study potential near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations. We investigate the use of variational algorithms for solving $Ax = b$ and analyze the optimization landscape for variational algorithms. We found that a wide range of variational algorithms designed to avoid barren plateaus, such as properly-initialized imaginary time evolution and adiabatic-inspired optimization, still suffer from a fundamentally different plateau problem. To circumvent this issue, we design a potentially near-term adaptive alternating algorithm based on a core idea: the classical combination of variational quantum states. We have conducted numerical experiments solving linear systems as large as $2^{300} \times 2^{300}$ by considering special systems that can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. These experiments demonstrate the algorithm's ability to scale to system sizes within reach in near-term quantum devices of about $100$-$300$ qubits.</description>

    <title>A Quantum Search Decoder for Natural Language Processing</title>

    <description>Probabilistic language models, e.g. those based on an LSTM, often face the problem of finding a high probability prediction from a sequence of random variables over a set of words. This is commonly addressed using a form of greedy decoding such as beam search, where a limited number of highest-likelihood paths (the beam width) of the decoder are kept, and at the end the maximum-likelihood path is chosen. The resulting algorithm has linear runtime in the beam width. However, the input is not necessarily distributed such that a high-likelihood input symbol at any given time step also leads to the global optimum. Limiting the beam width can thus result in a failure to recognise long-range dependencies. In practice, only an exponentially large beam width can guarantee that the global optimum is found: for an input of length $n$ and average parser branching ratio $R$, the baseline classical algorithm needs to query the input on average $R^n$ times. In this work, we construct a quantum algorithm to find the globally optimal parse with high constant success probability. Given the input to the decoder is distributed like a power-law with exponent $k>0$, our algorithm yields a runtime $R^{n f(R,k)}$, where $f\le 1/2$, and $f\rightarrow 0$ exponentially quickly for growing $k$. This implies that our algorithm always yields a super-Grover type speedup, i.e. it is more than quadratically faster than its classical counterpart. We further modify our procedure to recover a quantum beam search variant, which enables an even stronger empirical speedup, while sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we apply this quantum beam search decoder to Mozilla's implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech neural net, which we show to exhibit such a power law word rank frequency, underpinning the applicability of our model.</description>

    <title>Oracle complexity classes and local measurements on physical Hamiltonians</title>

    <description>The canonical problem for the class Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA) is that of estimating ground state energies of local Hamiltonians. Perhaps surprisingly, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] showed that the related, but arguably more natural, problem of simulating local measurements on ground states of local Hamiltonians (APX-SIM) is likely harder than QMA. Indeed, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] showed that APX-SIM is P^QMA[log]-complete, for P^QMA[log] the class of languages decidable by a P machine making a logarithmic number of adaptive queries to a QMA oracle. In this work, we show that APX-SIM is P^QMA[log]-complete even when restricted to more physical Hamiltonians, obtaining as intermediate steps a variety of related complexity-theoretic results. We first give a sequence of results which together yield P^QMA[log]-hardness for APX-SIM on well-motivated Hamiltonians: (1) We show that for NP, StoqMA, and QMA oracles, a logarithmic number of adaptive queries is equivalent to polynomially many parallel queries. These equalities simplify the proofs of our subsequent results. (2) Next, we show that the hardness of APX-SIM is preserved under Hamiltonian simulations (a la [Cubitt, Montanaro, Piddock, 2017]). As a byproduct, we obtain a full complexity classification of APX-SIM, showing it is complete for P, P^||NP, P^||StoqMA, or P^||QMA depending on the Hamiltonians employed. (3) Leveraging the above, we show that APX-SIM is P^QMA[log]-complete for any family of Hamiltonians which can efficiently simulate spatially sparse Hamiltonians, including physically motivated models such as the 2D Heisenberg model. Our second focus considers 1D systems: We show that APX-SIM remains P^QMA[log]-complete even for local Hamiltonians on a 1D line of 8-dimensional qudits. This uses a number of ideas from above, along with replacing the "query Hamiltonian" of [Ambainis, CCC 2014] with a new "sifter" construction.</description>

    <title>Geometric R√©nyi Divergence and its Applications in Quantum Channel Capacities</title>

    <description>We present a systematic study of the geometric R√©nyi divergence (GRD), also known as the maximal R√©nyi divergence, from the point of view of quantum information theory. We show that this divergence, together with its extension to channels, has many appealing structural properties. For example we prove a chain rule inequality that immediately implies the "amortization collapse" for the geometric R√©nyi divergence, addressing an open question by Berta et al. [arXiv:1808.01498, Equation (55)] in the area of quantum channel discrimination. As applications, we explore various channel capacity problems and construct new channel information measures based on the geometric R√©nyi divergence, sharpening the previously best-known bounds based on the max-relative entropy while still keeping the new bounds single-letter efficiently computable. A plethora of examples are investigated and the improvements are evident for almost all cases.</description>

    <title>Correlation measures and distillable entanglement in AdS/CFT</title>

    <description>Recent developments have exposed close connections between quantum information and holography. In this paper, we explore the geometrical interpretations of the recently introduced $Q$-correlation and $R$-correlation, $E_Q$ and $E_R$. We find that $E_Q$ admits a natural geometric interpretation via the surface-state correspondence: it is a minimal mutual information between a surface region $A$ and a cross-section of $A$'s entanglement wedge with $B$. We note a strict trade-off between this minimal mutual information and the symmetric side-channel assisted distillable entanglement from the environment $E$ to $A$, $I^{ss}(E\rangle A)$. We also show that the $R$-correlation, $E_R$, coincides holographically with the entanglement wedge cross-section. This further elucidates the intricate relationship between entanglement, correlations, and geometry in holographic field theories.</description>

    <title>On the natural gradient for variational quantum eigensolver</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05074</link>
    <author>Naoki Yamamoto</author>

    <description>The variational quantum eigensolver is a hybrid algorithm composed of quantum state driving and classical parameter optimization, for finding the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The natural gradient method is an optimization method taking into account the geometric structure of the parameter space. Very recently, Stokes et al. developed the general method for employing the natural gradient for the variational quantum eigensolver. This paper gives some simple case-studies of this optimization method, to see in detail how the natural gradient optimizer makes use of the geometric property to change and improve the ordinary gradient method.</description>

    <title>Robustness-optimized quantum error correction</title>

    <description>Quantum error correction codes are usually designed to correct errors regardless of their physical origins. In large-scale devices, this is an essential feature. In smaller-scale devices, however, the main error sources are often understood, and this knowledge could be exploited for more efficient error correction. Optimizing the quantum error correction protocol is therefore a promising strategy in smaller devices. Typically, this involves tailoring the protocol to a given decoherence channel by solving an appropriate optimization problem. Here we introduce a new optimization-based approach, which maximizes the robustness to faults in the recovery. Our approach is inspired by recent experiments, where such faults have been a significant source of logical errors. We illustrate this approach with a three-qubit model, and show how near-term experiments could benefit from more robust quantum error correction protocols.</description>
