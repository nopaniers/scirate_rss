    <title>Faster quantum and classical SDP approximations for quadratic binary optimization</title>

    <description>We give a quantum speedup for solving the canonical semidefinite programming relaxation for binary quadratic optimization. The class of relaxations for combinatorial optimization has so far eluded quantum speedups. Our methods combine ideas from quantum Gibbs sampling and matrix exponent updates. A de-quantization of the algorithm also leads to a faster classical solver. For generic instances, our quantum solver gives a nearly quadratic speedup over state-of-the-art algorithms. We also provide an efficient randomized rounding procedure that converts approximately optimal SDP solutions into constant factor approximations of the original quadratic optimization problem.</description>

    <description>Distillation, which generally means converting noisy states into better approximations of some valuable pure states by low-cost operations, is a fundamental type of resource trading protocol that plays major roles in quantum computation and information processing. In this work, we establish a series of fundamental limits to the efficiency of distillation with finite resources which apply to any reasonable resource theory, using an information-theoretic tool called the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy. We show that, for highly generic noisy inputs, there is an insuperable limitation to the accuracy (or lower bound on the error) of any distillation protocol, even probabilistic ones. More explicitly, our bounds indicate a forbidden regime of the accuracy and success probability that no protocol with the corresponding parameters can exist. We use these no-go theorems to derive bounds which imply that the total overhead i.e. the number of noisy inputs needed to distill a pure resource state with small error $\epsilon$ must scale at least as $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$. This allows us to establish specific lower bounds on the cost of magic state distillation, a task crucial to fault-tolerant quantum computation, which in particular address an open problem raised by Hastings and Haah [PRL 120, 050504 (2018)]. Finally, we showcase a basic no-go result for simulating unitary resource channels to demonstrate that the analogous understandings may extend to channel resource theories.</description>

    <title>Variational algorithms for linear algebra</title>

    <description>Quantum algorithms have been developed for efficiently solving linear algebra tasks. However they generally require deep circuits and therefore universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we propose variational algorithms for linear algebra tasks that are compatible with Noisy Intermediate Scaled Quantum devices. We show that the solutions of linear systems of equations and matrix-vector multiplications can be translated as the ground states of the constructed Hamiltonians. Based on recently proposed variational quantum algorithms, we introduce Hamiltonian morphing together with an adaptive ansatz for efficiently finding the ground state. As the ground state always has zero energy, it also enables us to verify the solution. Our algorithms have wide applications in machine learning and optimisation problems, and the algorithm for matrix multiplications can be also used for variational Hamiltonian simulation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations of the algorithm for solving linear systems of equations.</description>

    <title>Quantum Brascamp-Lieb Dualities</title>

    <description>Brascamp-Lieb inequalities are entropy inequalities which have a dual formulation as generalized Young inequalities. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum version of this duality, relating quantum relative entropy inequalities to matrix exponential inequalities of Young type. We demonstrate this novel duality by means of examples from quantum information theory - including entropic uncertainty relations, strong data-processing inequalities, super-additivity inequalities, and many more. As an application we find novel uncertainty relations for Gaussian quantum operations that can be interpreted as quantum duals of the well-known family of geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequalities.</description>

    <pubDate>Sep 12 2019</pubDate>
    <description>We describe a resource-efficient approach to studying many-body quantum states on noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. We employ a sequential generation model that allows to bound the range of correlations in the resulting many-body quantum states. From this, we characterize situations where the estimation of local observables does not require the preparation of the entire state. Instead smaller patches of the state can be generated from which the observables can be estimated. This reduces the required circuit size and number of qubits for the computation of physical properties of quantum matter. Moreover, we show that the effect of noise decreases along the computation. Our results apply to a broad class of widely studied tensor network states and can be directly applied to near-term implementations of variational quantum algorithms.</description>

    <description>A quantum generalization of Natural Gradient Descent is presented as part of a general-purpose optimization framework for variational quantum circuits. The optimization dynamics is interpreted as moving in the steepest descent direction with respect to the Quantum Information Geometry, corresponding to the real part of the Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT), also known as the Fubini-Study metric tensor. An efficient algorithm is presented for computing a block-diagonal approximation to the Fubini-Study metric tensor for parametrized quantum circuits, which may be of independent interest.</description>

    <title>On the Universality of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>

    <description>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is considered to be one of the most promising approaches towards using near-term quantum computers for practical application. In its original form, the algorithm applies two different Hamiltonians, called the mixer and the cost Hamiltonian, in alternation with the goal being to approach the ground state of the cost Hamiltonian. Recently, it has been suggested that one might use such a set-up as a parametric quantum circuit with possibly some other goal than reaching ground states. From this perspective, a recent work [S. Lloyd, arXiv:1812.11075] argued that for one-dimensional local cost Hamiltonians, composed of nearest neighbor ZZ terms, this set-up is quantum computationally universal, i.e., all unitaries can be reached up to arbitrary precision. In the present paper, we give the complete proof of this statement and the precise conditions under which such a one-dimensional QAOA might be considered universal. We further generalize this type of universality for certain cost Hamiltonians with ZZ and ZZZ terms arranged according to the adjacency structure of certain graphs and hypergraphs.</description>

    <description>We report our work on the Alibaba Cloud Quantum Development Platform (AC-QDP). The capability of AC-QDP's computational engine was already reported in \citeCZH+18, ZHN+19.In this follow-up article, we demonstrate with figures how AC-QDP helps in testing large-scale quantum algorithms (currently within the QAOA framework). We give new benchmark results on regular graphs. AC-QDP's QAOA framework can simulate thousands of qubits for up to $4$ layers. Then we discuss two interesting use cases we have implemented on the platform: 1. Optimal QAOA sequences for small-cycle free graphs; 2. Graph structure discovery.</description>

    <title>Playing Games with Multiple Access Channels</title>

    <description>Communication networks have multiple users, each sending and receiving messages. A multiple access channel (MAC) models multiple senders transmitting to a single receiver, such as the uplink from many mobile phones to a single base station. The optimal performance of a MAC is quantified by a capacity region of simultaneously achievable communication rates. We study the two-sender classical MAC, the simplest and best-understood network, and find a surprising richness in both a classical and quantum context. First, we find that quantum entanglement shared between senders can substantially boost the capacity of a classical MAC. Second, we find that optimal performance of a MAC with bounded-size inputs may require unbounded amounts of entanglement. Third, determining whether a perfect communication rate is achievable using finite-dimensional entanglement is undecidable. Finally, we show that evaluating the capacity region of a two-sender classical MAC is in fact NP-hard.</description>

    <title>Correlation measures and distillable entanglement in AdS/CFT</title>

    <description>Recent developments have exposed close connections between quantum information and holography. In this paper, we explore the geometrical interpretations of the recently introduced $Q$-correlation and $R$-correlation, $E_Q$ and $E_R$. We find that $E_Q$ admits a natural geometric interpretation via the surface-state correspondence: it is a minimal mutual information between a surface region $A$ and a cross-section of $A$'s entanglement wedge with $B$. We note a strict trade-off between this minimal mutual information and the symmetric side-channel assisted distillable entanglement from the environment $E$ to $A$, $I^{ss}(E\rangle A)$. We also show that the $R$-correlation, $E_R$, coincides holographically with the entanglement wedge cross-section. This further elucidates the intricate relationship between entanglement, correlations, and geometry in holographic field theories.</description>

    <title>Quantifying LOSR nonclassicality across arbitrary resource types</title>

    <description>In space-like separated experiments and other scenarios where multiple parties share a classical common cause but no cause-effect relations, quantum theory allows a variety of nonsignaling resources which are useful for distributed quantum information processing. These include quantum states, nonlocal boxes, steering assemblages, teleportages, channel steering assemblages, and so on. Such resources are often studied using nonlocal games, semiquantum games, entanglement-witnesses, teleportation experiments, and similar tasks. We introduce a unifying framework which subsumes the full range of nonsignaling resources, as well as the games and experiments which probe them, into a common resource theory: that of local operations and shared randomness (LOSR). Crucially, we allow these LOSR operations to locally change the type of a resource, so that players can convert resources of any type into resources of any other type, and in particular into strategies for the specific type of game they are playing. We then prove several theorems relating resources and games of different types. These theorems generalize a number of seminal results from the literature, and can be applied to lessen the assumptions and technological requirements needed to characterize the nonclassicality of certain types of resources. As just one example, we prove that semiquantum games are able to perfectly characterize the LOSR nonclassicality of every resource of any type (not just quantum states, as was previously shown). As a consequence, we show that any resource can be characterized in a measurement-device-independent manner.</description>

    <title>A Quantum Search Decoder for Natural Language Processing</title>

    <description>Probabilistic language models, e.g. those based on an LSTM, often face the problem of finding a high probability prediction from a sequence of random variables over a set of words. This is commonly addressed using a form of greedy decoding such as beam search, where a limited number of highest-likelihood paths (the beam width) of the decoder are kept, and at the end the maximum-likelihood path is chosen. The resulting algorithm has linear runtime in the beam width. However, the input is not necessarily distributed such that a high-likelihood input symbol at any given time step also leads to the global optimum. Limiting the beam width can thus result in a failure to recognise long-range dependencies. In practice, only an exponentially large beam width can guarantee that the global optimum is found: for an input of length $n$ and average parser branching ratio $R$, the baseline classical algorithm needs to query the input on average $R^n$ times. In this work, we construct a quantum algorithm to find the globally optimal parse with high constant success probability. Given the input to the decoder is distributed like a power-law with exponent $k>0$, our algorithm yields a runtime $R^{n f(R,k)}$, where $f\le 1/2$, and $f\rightarrow 0$ exponentially quickly for growing $k$. This implies that our algorithm always yields a super-Grover type speedup, i.e. it is more than quadratically faster than its classical counterpart. We further modify our procedure to recover a quantum beam search variant, which enables an even stronger empirical speedup, while sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we apply this quantum beam search decoder to Mozilla's implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech neural net, which we show to exhibit such a power law word rank frequency, underpinning the applicability of our model.</description>

    <title>Optimizing Clifford gate generation for measurement-only topological quantum computation with Majorana zero modes</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03002</link>

    <pubDate>Sep 09 2019</pubDate>
    <description>One of the main challenges for quantum computation is that while the number of gates required to perform a non-trivial quantum computation may be very large, decoherence and errors in realistic quantum architectures limits the number of physical gate operations that can be performed coherently. Therefore, an optimal mapping of the quantum algorithm into the physically available set of operations is of crucial importance. We examine this problem for a measurement-only topological quantum computer based on Majorana zero modes, where gates are performed through sequences of measurements. Such a scheme has been proposed as a practical, scalable approach to process quantum information in an array of topological qubits built using Majorana zero modes. Building on previous work that has shown that multi-qubit Clifford gates can be enacted in a topologically protected fashion in such qubit networks, we discuss methods to obtain the optimal measurement sequence for a given Clifford gate under the constraints imposed by the physical architecture, such as layout and the relative difficulty of implementing different types of measurements. Our methods also provide tools for comparative analysis of different architectures and strategies, given experimental characterizations of particular aspects of the systems under consideration.</description>

    <title>Generalized topological state-sum constructions and their universality</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03031</link>
    <author>Andreas Bauer</author>
    <pubDate>Sep 09 2019</pubDate>
    <description>We formalize and generalize the concept of a topological state-sum construction using the language of tensor networks. We give examples for constructions that are possibly more general than all state-sum constructions in the literature that we are aware of. In particular we propose a state-sum construction that is universal in the sense that it can emulate every other state-sum construction. Physically, state-sum models in $n$ dimensions correspond to fixed point models for topological phases of matter in $n$ space-time dimensions. We conjecture that our universal state-sum construction contains fixed point models for topological phases that are not captured by known constructions. In particular we demonstrate that, unlike common state-sum constructions, the construction is compatible with the absence of gapped boundaries and commuting-projector Hamiltonians in $2+1$-dimensional chiral topological phases.</description>
