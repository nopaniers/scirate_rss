    <title>Optimizing Clifford gate generation for measurement-only topological quantum computation with Majorana zero modes</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03002</link>
    <author>Alan Tran, Alex Bocharov, Bela Bauer, Parsa Bonderson</author>
    <description>One of the main challenges for quantum computation is that while the number of gates required to perform a non-trivial quantum computation may be very large, decoherence and errors in realistic quantum architectures limits the number of physical gate operations that can be performed coherently. Therefore, an optimal mapping of the quantum algorithm into the physically available set of operations is of crucial importance. We examine this problem for a measurement-only topological quantum computer based on Majorana zero modes, where gates are performed through sequences of measurements. Such a scheme has been proposed as a practical, scalable approach to process quantum information in an array of topological qubits built using Majorana zero modes. Building on previous work that has shown that multi-qubit Clifford gates can be enacted in a topologically protected fashion in such qubit networks, we discuss methods to obtain the optimal measurement sequence for a given Clifford gate under the constraints imposed by the physical architecture, such as layout and the relative difficulty of implementing different types of measurements. Our methods also provide tools for comparative analysis of different architectures and strategies, given experimental characterizations of particular aspects of the systems under consideration.</description>

    <title>Generalized topological state-sum constructions and their universality</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03031</link>
    <author>Andreas Bauer</author>
    <description>We formalize and generalize the concept of a topological state-sum construction using the language of tensor networks. We give examples for constructions that are possibly more general than all state-sum constructions in the literature that we are aware of. In particular we propose a state-sum construction that is universal in the sense that it can emulate every other state-sum construction. Physically, state-sum models in $n$ dimensions correspond to fixed point models for topological phases of matter in $n$ space-time dimensions. We conjecture that our universal state-sum construction contains fixed point models for topological phases that are not captured by known constructions. In particular we demonstrate that, unlike common state-sum constructions, the construction is compatible with the absence of gapped boundaries and commuting-projector Hamiltonians in $2+1$-dimensional chiral topological phases.</description>
